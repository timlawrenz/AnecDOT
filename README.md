# AnecDOT: Graph-of-Thought Reasoning with DOT

> Teaching LLMs to think structurally through Graphviz DOT language

## Overview

AnecDOT is a research project exploring the use of DOT (Graphviz) as an intermediate reasoning format for Large Language Models. Instead of forcing LLMs to approach complex planning tasks linearly, we train specialized models to generate formal graph representations that capture dependencies, state transitions, and architectural structures.

This repository contains the **Factory** (Repo A) - the open-source tooling for dataset generation, model training, and validation. The generated datasets are maintained separately under EPL-2.0 licensing.

## Motivation

Current LLMs struggle with:
- **Long-horizon planning**: Multi-step tasks with complex dependencies
- **Structural reasoning**: Understanding relationships between components
- **State management**: Tracking transitions and flow control

By introducing DOT as an intermediate representation, we enable models to:
- Express complex logic as verifiable graph structures
- Separate architectural planning from implementation details
- Enable graph-based orchestration of multi-agent workflows

## Project Goals

1. **Phase I**: Build a high-quality dataset of `(Natural Language → DOT)` and `(Code → DOT)` pairs
2. **Phase II**: Fine-tune small-to-mid-sized models (Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3 8B) to generate syntactically valid and semantically accurate DOT graphs
3. **Future**: Enable graph-based orchestration where DOT output drives agentic workflows

## Architecture

### Dataset Generation (Phase I)

Three data streams feed the training pipeline:

#### 📚 Documentation Stream
- **Source**: Graphviz.org gallery, guides, and attribute references
- **Method**: HTML scraping of examples
- **Purpose**: Foundational syntax and attribute usage

#### 🔧 Logic Stream
- **Source**: Open-source FSM libraries (`python-statemachine`, `aasm`, etc.)
- **Method**: Static analysis + dynamic `.to_dot()` execution
- **Purpose**: Code-to-graph abstraction

#### 🤖 Synthetic Stream
- **Source**: Teacher LLMs (Gemini, Ollama) + seed prompts
- **Method**: Few-shot prompting with grounded examples + compiler verification
- **Purpose**: Dataset augmentation with diverse scenarios
- **Status**: ✅ Validated (60 examples, 100% success rate)
- **Coverage**: State machines, workflows, architecture diagrams, decision trees, network topology

**Current Dataset Status (as of 2025-11-20):**
- Documentation Stream: 44 pairs (13 gallery + 31 attributes)
- Logic Stream: 106 pairs (statemachine_cat: 92 + others: 14)
- FSM Extraction: 14 pairs (transitions: 7, fsmdot: 7)
- Synthetic Stream: 10 pairs
- **Total: ~174 training pairs** (all 100% syntactically validated)
- **Phase II.1 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Training validated with 56% success rate
- **Phase II.2 Status**: 🔄 READY - 14% more data, ready for next training run
- **Sources tracked**: data/sources.txt, docs/FSM_EXTRACTION_REPORT.md

```json
{
  "id": "unique_id_123",
  "source": "graphviz_gallery",
  "license": "EPL-2.0",

```

### Model Training (Phase II)

**Phase II.1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE** (2025-01-20)

**Results Summary:**
- **Base Model**: google/gemma-2b-it - 0/16 valid DOT graphs (0%)
- **Fine-tuned Model**: 9/16 valid DOT graphs (56.2%)
- **Statistical Significance**: z = 3.54, p < 0.001 ✅
- **Conclusion**: Fine-tuning works! 160 pairs sufficient for proof-of-concept

See `training/TRAINING_RESULTS.md` for detailed analysis.

**Infrastructure**: QLoRA training pipeline implemented in `training/`
- **Proof-of-concept Model**: Gemma-2B-IT (2B parameters, instruction-tuned)
- **Technique**: QLoRA (4-bit quantization + LoRA adapters)
- **Hardware**: Consumer GPU (8GB+ VRAM, ~75 second training time)
- **Dataset**: 153 pairs split 137 train / 16 validation
- **Key Learning**: Chat template format is critical for success

**Next steps (Phase II.2):**
- Scale to larger models (Gemma-7B, Llama-3-8B) for improved performance
- Expand dataset to 250-350 pairs
- Increase training epochs and optimize hyperparameters
- Implement semantic evaluation metrics

See `training/README.md` for setup and execution details.

Contributions are welcome! This is an experimental research project exploring novel approaches to LLM reasoning. By contributing, you help advance publicly available research that benefits the entire community.

## Future Vision: The Orchestrator

Once models reliably generate DOT graphs, they become engines for **graph-based agentic workflows**:

1. Model generates a dependency graph (the plan)
2. Python orchestrator traverses the graph
3. Each node executes with context from predecessor nodes
4. Edges act as data pipelines between specialized models

This decouples the "Planner" (local DOT model) from "Workers" (coding models), enabling complex multi-step software generation on consumer hardware.
